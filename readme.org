* 4channescript
  this perl scripts gets the time stamp from the 4chan filename (which is unix time
  in milliseconds) and gives it to the file using =touch=
  Run this in a directory with 4chan files for example, a directory
  like this:
  #+BEGIN_SRC

1492928441486.png
1584736206383.jpg
1584792153783.png
  #+END_SRC

The script will do what it does to every file that begins with 1. So
i'll have to update this script in 2033-05-18.
